Intel® AI for Enterprise RAG simplifies transforming your enterprise data into actionable insights. Powered by Intel® Gaudi® AI accelerators and Intel® Xeon® processors, it integrates components from industry partners to offer a streamlined approach to deploying enterprise solutions. It scales seamlessly with proven orchestration frameworks, providing the flexibility and choice your enterprise needs.

Building on the strong foundation of OPEA, Intel® AI for Enterprise RAG extends this base with key features that enhance scalability, security, and user experience. These include integrated Service Mesh capabilities for seamless integration with modern service-based architectures, production-ready validation for pipeline reliability, and a feature-rich UI for RAG as a service to manage and monitor workflows easily. Additionally, Intel® and partner support provide access to a broad ecosystem of solutions, combined with integrated IAM with UI and application, ensuring secure and compliant operations. Programmable guardrails enable fine-grained control over pipeline behavior, allowing for customized security and compliance settings.

> [!NOTE]
The video provided above showcases the beta release of our project. As we transition to the 1.0 version, users can anticipate an improved UI design along with other minor enhancements. While many features remain consistent with the beta, the 1.0 release will offer a more refined user experience.

**ChatQnA**

The ChatQnA solution uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) architecture, quickly becoming the industry standard for chatbot development. It combines the benefits of a knowledge base (via a vector store) and generative models to reduce hallucinations, maintain up-to-date information, and leverage domain-specific knowledge.

## Hardware Prerequisites for Deployment using Gaudi® AI Accelerator

To deploy the solution on a platform with Gaudi® AI Accelerator we need to have access to instance with minimal requirements:

-  **logical cores**: A minimum of `48` logical cores
-  **RAM memory**: A minimum of `250GB` of RAM though this is highly dependent on database size
-  **Disk Space**: `1TB` of disk space is generally recommended, though this is highly dependent on the model size and database size
-  **Gaudi cards**: `8`
-  **Latest Gaudi driver**: To check your Gaudi version, `run hl-smi`. If Gaudi version doesn't match the required version, upgrade it by following [this tutorial](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Driver_Installation.html).


If you don't have a Gaudi® AI Accelerator, you can request these instances in [Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud](https://console.cloud.intel.com/home) to run Intel® AI for Enterprise RAG.

- visit [Intel® Tiber™ AI Cloud](https://console.cloud.intel.com/home).
- In the left pane select `Catalog > Hardware`.
- Select `Gaudi® 2 Deep Learning Server` or `Gaudi® 2 Deep Learning Server - Dell`.
- Select the Machine image - for example: `ubuntu-2204-gaudi2-1.17.0-vm-v4` with `Architecture: X86_64 (Baremetal only)`. Please note that minor version tags may change over time.
- Upload your public key and launch the instance
- Navigate to the `Instances` page and verify that the machine has reached its ready state, then click on "How to Connect via SSH" to configure your machine correctly for further installation.

## Hardware Prerequisites for Deployment using Xeon only
To deploy the solution on a platform using 4th or 5th generation Intel® Xeon® processors, you will need:
- access to any platform with Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors that meet bellow requirements:
-  **logical cores**: A minimum of `80` logical cores
-  **RAM memory**: A minimum of `250GB` of RAM
-  **Disk Space**: `500GB` of disk space is generally recommended, though this is highly dependent on the model size

### Software Prerequisites

Refer to the [prerequisites](./docs/prerequisites.md) guide for detailed instructions to install the components mentioned below:

-   **Kubernetes Cluster**: Access to a Kubernetes v1.29-v1.31 cluster
-   **CSI Driver**: The K8s cluster must have the CSI driver installed. Users can define their own CSI driver that will be used during EnterpriseRAG install; however StorageClass provided by CSI driver should support ReadWriteMany(RWX) in case of using a multi-node cluster.
- Current solution was tested on a single node using the CSI driver [local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner), with  `local_path_provisioner_claim_root`  set to  `/mnt`. For an example of how to set up Kubernetes via Kubespray, refer to the prerequisites guide:  [CSI Driver](./docs/prerequisites.md#csi-driver).
-   **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04
-   **Hugging Face Model Access**: Ensure you have the necessary access to download and use the chosen Hugging Face model. This default model used is `Mixtral-8x7B` for which access needs to be requested. Visit  [Mixtral-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) to apply for access.

#### Additional Software Prerequisites when using Gaudi® AI Accelerator
-   **Gaudi Software Stack**: Verify that your setup uses a valid software stack for Gaudi accelerators, see  [Gaudi support matrix](https://docs.habana.ai/en/latest/Support_Matrix/Support_Matrix.html). Note that running LLM on a CPU is possible but will significantly reduce performance.
-   **Prepared Gaudi Node**: Please refer to the [Gaudi Software Stack](./docs/prerequisites.md#gaudi-software-stack) section of the prerequisites section.

# Installation

```

> [!NOTE]
> In case we are deploying the solution on `Xeon`, please change the `PIPELINE` parameter to the pipeline dedicated for Xeon, for example, `xeon_torch_llm_guard`. For more information, refer to [Configure Pipeline](docs/configure_pipeline.md).

Proxy variables are optional.
