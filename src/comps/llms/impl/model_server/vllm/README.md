# vLLM LLM Model Server

This document focuses on using the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) as a LLM.

vLLM is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference and serving, it delivers state-of-the-art serving throughput with a set of advanced features such as PagedAttention, Continuous batching and etc. Besides GPUs, vLLM already supported [Intel CPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/overview.html) and [Gaudi accelerators](https://habana.ai/products). This guide provides an example on how to launch vLLM serving endpoint on CPU and Gaudi accelerators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
Provide your Hugging Face API key to enable access to Hugging Face models. Alternatively, you can set this in the dotenv configuration files.
```bash
export HF_TOKEN=${your_hf_api_token}
```

Also, create a folder to preserve model data on host and change the ownership to the id that would match user in the image:
```bash
mkdir -p docker/data/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./docker/data
```

### 🚀 Start the vLLM Service via script (Option 1)
#### Run the script

```bash
# for hpu device (default)
export LLM_DEVICE='hpu'

# for cpu device
export LLM_DEVICE='cpu'

chmod +x run_vllm.sh
./run_vllm.sh
```
The script initiates a Docker container with the vLLM model server running on port `LLM_VLLM_PORT` (default: **8008**). Configuration settings are specified in the environment configuration files [docker/hpu/.env](docker/hpu/.env) and [docker/cpu/.env](docker/cpu/.env) files. You can adjust these settings by modifying the appropriate dotenv file or by exporting environment variables.

#### Verify the vLLM Service
Below examples are presented for hpu device.

First, check the logs to confirm the service is operational:
```bash
docker logs -f llm-vllm-model-server
```

The following log messages indicate that the startup of model server is completed:
```bash
INFO 09-05 12:17:56 habana_model_runner.py:940] [Warmup][Decode][1023/1024] batch_size:2 seq_len:16 free_mem:5.414 GiB

```

### 🚀 Deploy vLLM Service with LLM Microservice using Docker Compose (Option 2)

To launch vLLM Service along with the LLM Microservice, follow these steps:

#### Modify the environment configuration file to align it to your case

For HPU device (Gaudi), modify the `./docker/.env.hpu` file:

```env
#HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-api-key>

## VLLM Model Server Settings ##
LLM_VLLM_MODEL_NAME="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"
LLM_VLLM_PORT=8008

HABANA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
OMPI_MCA_btl_vader_single_copy_mechanism=none
PT_HPU_ENABLE_LAZY_COLLECTIVES=true
PT_HPU_LAZY_ACC_PAR_MODE=0
VLLM_CPU_KVCACHE_SPACE=40
VLLM_DTYPE=bfloat16
VLLM_MAX_NUM_SEQS=128
VLLM_SKIP_WARMUP=false
VLLM_TP_SIZE=1

[...]
```

#### Start the Services using Docker Compose

To build and start the services using Docker Compose

```bash
# for CPU device
cd docker/cpu
mkdir -p data
export UID && docker compose --env-file=.env -f docker-compose.yaml up --build -d

# for HPU device (Gaudi)
cd docker/hpu
mkdir -p data
docker compose --env-file=.env -f docker-compose.yaml up --build -d
```

Note: Due to secure container best practices, main process is started as non-privileged user.
Due to the fact it uses volume mounts, the volume directory `data/` must be created beforehand.

#### Service Cleanup

To cleanup the services using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd docker

# for HPU device (Gaudi)
docker compose -f docker-compose-hpu.yaml down
```

### Verify the Services

- Test the `llm-vllm-model-server` using the following command:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8008/v1/completions \
        -X POST \
        -d '{"model": "Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3", "prompt": "What is Deep Learning?", "max_tokens": 32, "temperature": 0}' \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```
    **NOTICE**: First ensure that the model server is operational. Warming up might take a while, and during this phase, the endpoint won't be ready to serve the query.

- Check the `llm-vllm-microservice` status:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:9000/v1/health_check \
        -X GET \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

- Test the `llm-vllm-microservice` for **non-streaming mode** using the following command:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:9000/v1/chat/completions \
        -X POST \
        -d '{
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "role": "system",

                    },
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": "### Question: What is Deep Learning? \n\n"
                    }

                "stream":false
            }' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

- Test the `llm-vllm-microservice` for **streaming mode** using the following command:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:9000/v1/chat/completions \
        -X POST \
        -d '{
                "messages": [
                    {
                        "role": "system",
                        "content": "### You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant to help the user with questions. Please refer to the search results obtained from the local knowledge base.

                    },
                    {
                        "role": "user",
                        "content": "### Question: What is Deep Learning? \n\n"
                    }
                ],
                "max_new_tokens":32,
                "top_p":0.95,

            }' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
    ```

### Run FP8 Quantization with vLLM on HPU device

In order to work with a fp8 quantized model, you need to do the following:
* Perform model quantization with provided utility. Only needed if model isn't quantized.
* Run vLLM with FP8 quantized model.

> [!NOTE]
> It's a known issue that `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` does not run after quantization with standard parameters.
>
> Currently the FP8 quantization was verified for model `Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3`. Other models need verification and may require some work to be fully supported.


#### Perform model quantization

1. Download dataset for calibration of model in `pkl` file format, e.g. open-orca dataset.
1. Modify `docker/.env.hpu` file - add `HF_TOKEN` and modify HABANA related envs to suit your needs.

   Minimal list of updated settings includes these:
    ```ini
    ## Provide your Hugging Face API key to enable access to Hugging Face models.
    HF_TOKEN=<your-hf-api-key>

    ## VLLM Model Server Settings ##
    LLM_VLLM_MODEL_NAME="Intel/neural-chat-7b-v3-3"

    ## FP8 Quantization settings
    FP8_DATASET_PATH=<path to calibration dataset in pkl format>
    ```

1. Define variable pointing to host directory containing models downloaded from Hugging Face:
    ```bash
    export HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE=<path to HF cache directory>
    ```
1. Run the provided docker container to quantize the model.

    ```bash
    cd model_server/vllm/fp8_vllm
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml --env-file ../docker/hpu/.env up --build
    ```

   After the quantization command concludes the hots model data directory will include subdirectory with quantization outcome, e.g.:
   `${HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE}/inc/<name_of_the_model>`.

#### Run vLLM with quantized model

1. Modify `docker/.env.hpu` file - add `HF_TOKEN` and modify HABANA related envs to suit your needs.
2. Ensure model and measurements will be reachable for vLLM under Hugging Face model directory, e.g.: `${HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE}/inc/<name_of_the_model>` or override the variable `QUANT_CONFIG`.
3. Run vLLM model server in FP8-enabled mode.
   ```bash
   cd model_server/vllm
   IF_FP8_QUANTIZATION=true ./run_vllm.sh
   ```
