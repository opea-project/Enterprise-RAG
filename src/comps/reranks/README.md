# Reranking Microservice

The Reranking Microservice, fueled by reranking models, stands as a straightforward yet immensely potent tool for semantic search. When provided with a query and a collection of documents, reranking swiftly indexes the documents based on their semantic relevance to the query, arranging them from most to least pertinent. This microservice significantly enhances overall accuracy. In a text retrieval system, either a dense embedding model or a sparse lexical search index is often employed to retrieve relevant text documents based on the input. However, a reranking model can further refine this process by rearranging potential candidates into a final, optimized order.

## Support matrix

Support for specific model servers with Dockerfiles or build instruction.

| Model server name               |  Status   |
| ---------------------------     | --------- |
| [TEI](./impl/model_server/tei/) | &#x2713;  |
| OVMS                            | &#x2717;  |


## Configuration Options

The configuration for the Reranking Microservice is specified in the [impl/microservice/.env](impl/microservice/.env) file. You can adjust these settings by modifing this dotenv file or by exporting environment variables.

| Environment Variable        | Description                                                                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RERANKING_USVC_PORT`       | The port of the microservice, by default 8000                              |
| `RERANKING_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`     | The endpoint of the reranking service, e.g., "http://localhost:6060" |


## Getting started

### Prerequisite: Start Reranking Model Server
The Reranking Microservice interacts with a rerank model endpoint,  twhich must be operational and accessible at the the URL specified by the `RERANKING_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` env.

Depending on the model server you want to use, follow the approppriate instructions in the [impl/model_server](impl/model_server/) directory to set up and start the service.

### ðŸš€1. Start Reranking Microservice with Python (Option 1)

To start the Reranking microservice, you need to install python packages first.

#### 1.1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r impl/microservice/requirements.txt
```

#### 1.2. Start Microservice

```bash
python opea_reranking_microservice.py
```

### ðŸš€2. Start Retranking Microservice with Docker (Option 2)

#### 2.1. Build the Docker Image:
Navigate to the `src` directory and use the docker build command to create the image:
```bash
cd ../../
docker build -t opea/reranking:latest -f comps/reranks/impl/microservice/Dockerfile .
```
Please note that the building process may take a while to complete.

#### 2.2. Run the Docker Container:
```bash
docker run -d --name="reranking-microservice" \
  --net=host \
  --ipc=host \
  opea/reranking:latest
```

If the model server is running at a different URL than the default, update the `RERANKING_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` variable accordingly. Here's an example of how to pass configuration using the docker run command:

```bash
docker run -d --name="reranking-microservice" \
  -e RERANKING_SERVICE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:6060 \
  --net=host \
  --ipc=host \
  opea/reranking:latest
```

### 3. Verify the Reraniking Microservice

#### 3.1. Check Status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/health_check \
  -X GET \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

####  3.2. Sending a Request

The `top_n` parameter allows you to specify the number of results returned by the reranker model. By default, the reranker returns only the top result (top_n=1). Adding the top_n parameter enables you to retrieve multiple ranked results, with the option to adjust it as needed.

**Example Input**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/reranking \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"initial_query":"What is Deep Learning?", "retrieved_docs": [{"text":"Deep Learning is not..."}, {"text":"Deep learning is..."}], "top_n":1}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

**Example Output**

The reranking microservice outputs a JSON containing the original user question, a list of relevant documents based on reranked top_n results, and a prompt template (may be null if the default is used) for generating a prompt based on the provided data.
```json
{
  "id": "d5d4102b8dc9414866d9c2ee550c9229",
  "data": {
    "initial_query": "What is Deep Learning?",
    "reranked_docs": [
      {
        "downstream_black_list": [],
        "id": "22c8b1d78b34945003101708494a24b6",
        "text": "Deep learning is...",
        "metadata": {}
      }
    ]
  },
  "prompt_template": null
}
```

## Additional Information
### Project Structure


The project is organized into several directories:

- `impl/`: This directory contains the implementation of the supported reranking service. It includes the `model_server` directory, which contains instructions for setting up and running different model servers, for example TEI.

- `utils/`: This directory contains utility scripts and modules that are used by the Reranking Microservice.
