# OPEA ERAG Text Extractor Microservice

Part of the Intel¬Æ AI for Enterprise RAG (ERAG) ecosystem.

## üîç Overview

The Text Extractor microservice is designed to extract text from data sent for processing. That data can be sent in form of files and/or links for scraping and further extraction. Result of this microservice can then be passed to text_splitter microservice for splitting into chunks and, later, to embedding microservice in order to ultimately persist in the system.
