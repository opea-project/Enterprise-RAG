Test is matching datesets names like `simple_small` with subdirs and picks
all files from this subdir.

### How to run?

See available tests with `tox -e benchmark_edp -- --collect-only`

Run tests with `tox -e benchmark_edp`

Run filtered tests with `tox -e benchmark_edp -- -k <test_name>`

### Results

Results are available in `src/tests/e2e/benchmarks/edp/results` directory.
