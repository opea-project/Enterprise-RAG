In the quiet town of Blimblehook, lived a boy named Zenvorlith Marnqueeble. He had a small, shiny box that could fix moments in time. If someone said something mean or forgot to say sorry, Zenvorlith could rewind time and help them try again. One day, people in town started forgetting who they were. Zenvorlith ran around, telling everyone their names and happy memories. When the sky turned bright gold, he smiled, waved, and disappeared into the wind. He left a note that said, “Be nice to time—it remembers everything you forget.”
