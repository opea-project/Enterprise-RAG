Alex – the Arctic Fox from the Northern Tundra
Alex is an Arctic fox who lives in the cold, snowy tundra regions of the Arctic Circle, including northern Canada, Alaska, and Greenland. Adapted to survive extreme cold, Alex has a thick, white fur coat that changes color with the seasons — white in winter to blend with the snow, and brown or gray in summer to match the tundra’s rocks and plants.

Alex is a carnivore and an opportunistic hunter, feeding on small animals like lemmings, birds, and fish. When food is scarce, Alex can also eat berries, seaweed, and even leftovers from larger predators. This clever fox is known for its keen sense of hearing and smell, which helps it locate prey hidden beneath the snow.

You can find Alex roaming the tundra mostly during the day, especially in the warmer months. His agility and thick fur make him perfectly suited for life in one of the world’s harshest environments.
