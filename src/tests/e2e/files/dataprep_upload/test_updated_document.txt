Alex – the Sloth from the Amazon Rainforest
Alex is a three-toed sloth who lives deep in the lush, green canopy of the Amazon rainforest in South America. Spending most of his life hanging upside down from tree branches, Alex moves very slowly and carefully. His fur is thick and slightly greenish because tiny algae grow on it, which help him blend perfectly with the leaves around him, protecting him from predators like jaguars and eagles.

Alex is a herbivore, feeding mostly on leaves, shoots, and occasionally some fruits he finds in the trees. Since leaves don’t provide much energy, Alex has adapted to conserve energy by moving slowly and resting for up to 20 hours a day. Despite his slow pace, Alex is an expert climber and uses his long claws to grip the branches tightly. If you ever visit the Amazon rainforest, you might spot him slowly munching on leaves or lazily drifting from branch to branch, a true master of camouflage and patience.
