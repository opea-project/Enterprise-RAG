The old watchmaker of Virelle lived above his tiny shop on Rue des Cloches, where every window trembled gently with the rhythm of his clocks. From dawn until candlelight, the air shimmered with thousands of ticking voices - steady, uneven, whispering seconds into eternity. People said he could fix anything that measured time: pocket watches that had stopped at heartbreak, tower bells that had forgotten to sing, even the grandfather clocks that groaned like old sailors remembering the sea.  One gray afternoon, as rain scribbled on his windows, a young girl stepped inside. Her coat was too large, her boots too wet, and her eyes too old. In her hand, she held a small pocket watch with a cracked glass face. "It belonged to my grandfather," she said softly. "It stopped the day he died. Can you make it remember?"  The watchmaker took it gently, turning it over between his fingers. "Everything remembers," he murmured. "Even silence keeps time." He opened the casing and found a chaos of bent gears and torn springs. It looked less like a machine and more like a wounded creature. He worked slowly, his fingers moving with care born of habit and reverence. As he repaired, he hummed an old lullaby - a tune his own father had once sung while mending watches in this same shop, decades ago.  Hours passed. The rain faded, then returned.
