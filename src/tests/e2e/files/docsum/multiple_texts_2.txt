The girl dozed in a wooden chair by the counter, lulled by the sound of countless clocks arguing softly about the hour. When the watchmaker finally spoke, his voice was barely louder than a whisper.  "There," he said. The pocket watch clicked once, then began to pulse - a steady, living rhythm.  The girl's eyes brightened. "It's perfect," she breathed.  He smiled, the corners of his mouth trembling like old paper. "No," he said. "It runs one second slow."  She frowned. "Why?"  "So you'll always have one second to decide differently."  Years later, when she had grown into a woman and carried the weight of choices heavier than time itself, the watch still ticked - one second behind the world. And in that pause, that single stolen heartbeat of hesitation, she would sometimes close her eyes and remember the old man of Virelle: how he built clocks not to measure life, but to make space for it.  And in that single second - always just a breath too late - she found her truest moments of grace.
