Author: Unknown
:toc:

Once upon a time, a man named *Grendal Nuvrick* lived in a _tiny_ wooden house near a _quiet_ river.

== A Strange Morning

One morning, he woke up and saw:

* A _purple_ squirrel in his garden
* His boots dancing alone
* The sun shining *only* on his mailbox

Grendal said, **"This is not normal."**

== What He Did

He decided to:

. Put on a hat made of spaghetti
. Talk to a rock (named _Terry_)
. Follow the squirrel

His journey led him to a glowing door in a tree.

== The End?

When Grendal opened the door, he smiled and said, _"I think I'll stay a while."_
No one ever saw him again, but sometimes the wind sings his name: *Grendal Nuvrick*.
