            In the misty highlands of Bravenreach, a reclusive herbalist named Tressivorn Quindle brewed potions unlike any other. His creations could heal wounds instantly, grant temporary strength, or even let someone understand the language of animals. The villagers, grateful yet wary, believed Tressivorn was both a blessing and a curse.

            One stormy evening, a desperate woman came to his door, begging for a potion to save her ailing child. Tressivorn agreed but warned her: the potion's magic required a price - a memory dear to her heart. Unable to bear the thought of losing her child, she accepted the terms. As the potion worked its miracle, the woman's most cherished memory - a sunny day by the river with her family - vanished from her mind forever. Tressivorn, burdened by guilt yet bound by the rules of his craft, retreated further into isolation.
